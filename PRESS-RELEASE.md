There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  >Relocalc

## Sub-Heading ##
  > The application targets individuals who are looking to move to a specific address in Austin, Tx. This will benefit users by giving a numerical score and graphical interface that estimates their satisfaction based on living priorities given my the users. 

## Summary ##
  > The home page will allow a user to enter an address and adjust sliders that allow the application to determine the priorities of the user. After accepting this information, the user will be redirected to a results page. The results page will display two things: 
  	1. A raw score computed by that application that represents the user's compatability level with the given a address.
  	2. A graph to give the user a visual representation of the information used to reach the final calculation.

## Problem ##
  > Relocalc aims to tackle the problem of people looking to obtain information about an unfamiliar place before deciding to move there.

## Solution ##
  > Relocalc offers a solution by giving the user data and giving them a numerical estimate of how satisfactory the location in questino will be. 

## Quote from You ##
  > "Know--before you go".

## How to Get Started ##
  > You need a potential destination. Enter that into the app, and Relocalc handles the rest.

## Customer Quote ##
  > "I had a hard time digging around to find information to help me decide if a potential home was a good fit for my family and I; then, I found Relocalc and everything was in one place. Thanks Relocalc!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Refer to the README for installation instructions and for a more technical description of the application.
